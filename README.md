# actively-demo-backend
demo backend for activley full stack SWE application. Basically a REST API built in django that trains, stores, and inferences multiple ML models. I used a pseudo database (dictionary stored in memory), that stores each trained model with a unique hash index, and returns that to the sender to use for inferencing.
